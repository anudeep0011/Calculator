# Calculator
This project is a Simple Calculator built using JSP (JavaServer Pages) for the frontend and Java Servlets for backend logic. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The project employs Bootstrap for responsive styling and HTML forms to handle user input.

The backend is implemented using a servlet that receives the user input, performs the calculation based on the selected operation, and sends the result back to the user.
